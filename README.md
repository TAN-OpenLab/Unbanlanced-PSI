# Unbanlanced-PSI
This protocol is based on the MiniPSI of Ohio State University at https://github.com/osu-crypto/MiniPSI.
If you have already deployed MiniPSI, put USPSI in \libPSI and replace main.cpp in \frontend.
$cmake .
$make -j
Or you can downlowd Unbalance-PSI and deploy from the beginning.
